                <h2>Hello! I'm Brody Kelly</h2>
                <p>Welcome to my personal portfolio! I'm excited to share my journey, passions, and professional aspirations with you.</p>
                <p>Currently, I'm pursuing a Bachelor's degree in Statistics with a minor in Consumer Insights and Analytics at the University of Minnesota Duluth. This unique combination allows me to blend data-driven decision making with deep consumer understanding.</p>
                <p>I from from St. Michael, Minnesota, where my foundation in athletics and academics was built. These activities played a large role in shaping my values and work ethic.</p>
                <div class="interests-section">
                    <h3>Athletics and Personal Growth</h3>
                    <p>Throughout my younger years, I was deeply involved in hockey and baseball, which instilled in me valuable lessons about teamwork, leadership, and perseverance. These sports weren't just activities; they were fundamental in developing my character and approach to challenges.</p>
                    <p>While my competitive sports days have evolved, I maintain my passion for athletics through golf and a dedicated fitness routine. I believe in the importance of physical wellness and maintain a consistent schedule of strength training six days a week, demonstrating my commitment to personal growth and discipline.</p>
                    <h3>Personal Stories/Experinces</h3>
                    <p>I have a love hate relationship with golf. Most of the time it is very enjoyable and great way to get outside and spend some time with friends, but every now and then it can become very frustrating, anyone who plays golf knows this. One hole you will hit every shot perfectly, but the very next you wont be able do anything close to what you were doing prevoiusly. </p>
                    <p>Hockey I truly love though. Whether it's watching or playing there is nothing that I would rather be doing in that moment. The teams I enjoy watching my get on my nerves from time to time but it is still one of my favorite things to see and experince. </p>

                    <h3>Present Day</h3>
                    <p>My time is primarily dedicated to academic excellence and professional development. When not engaged in coursework or professional responsibilities, I enjoy refining my golf game and maintaining an active lifestyle. This balance of intellectual and physical pursuits helps me maintain my health in all areas of life.</p>
